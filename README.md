# surfs_up
Module 9 

## Purpose

### Overview of the Analysis
- The purpose of the analysis was to determine whether a surf and ice cream shop would be a viable business for the months of June and December. The analysis was performed by data gathered with W.Avy, with all of the temperature data for Oahu. The procedure of the analysis involved using python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy. Temperature data for June and December was retrieved by using the session.query() method with a SQLite database. 

## Results

- The difference between June and December's temperature averages is only 4 degrees, and the maximum and minimum temperatures are all relatively close in comparison. With the overall maximum temperature of 85 degrees and June and overall minimum temperature of 56 degrees in December, it can be concluded that the ice cream shop year round could be a viable business. 

## Summary

- After retrieving and analyzing the gathered data, it appears that the year round weather in Oahu would have a minimal affect on opening an ice cream shop.
